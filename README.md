# MLB Simulator 2017

A GUI-based baseball game simulator with animation, real-life 2017 MLB rosters, and realistic statistical game engine.

## Description

A realistic baseball simulator game where you can simulate life-like MLB games. Users can select their teams, set their lineups, and choose their starting pitcher. Then, sit back and enjoy the animations as if you were watching a real baseball game. With customizable animation settings, users can skip ahead to the action, speed up/slow down gameplay, or enable auto-play to immerse yourself in the action.

The simulator uses 2016 MLB statistics to create a realistic game engine and model real 2017 MLB players. It used Beautiful Soup to scrape MLB statistics from MLB.com and create ratings (contact, power, speed, etc.) for each player. These ratings affect game engine output for each batter/pitcher matchup to match real-life player statistics.
